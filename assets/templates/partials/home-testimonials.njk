They gave a competitive quote, were more highly qualified than the others who gave similar quotes and provided excellent customer service. They even came back  a second time to help with my awning, without charging me.

                                    I give them my highest recommendation on being awning installation EXPERTS and providing outstanding customer service.</blockquote>

The end product is wonderful for our hot and sunny backyard area here in the tri-valley. I enjoy the shade it provides, as well as the pretty sky above at night and on less than hot days.</blockquote>

                                <blockquote class="whisper">I just had a wonderful experience with Sunset Canvas & Awning.  I contacted several awning companies to custom make an awning for our flooring store, Lawrence Flooring & Interiors.  After contacting 3 awning companies, Sunset Canvas & Awning outshined all the others in terms of response, knowledge, service, quality and competitive pricing.  I was completely in awe every step of the way with this professional company and their customer service.  The technician that came out to look at our site was Greg Parr.  He was fantastic and was very knowledgeable, efficient and helped me understand my options.  Every time I called with a question, Greg immediately got back to me with complete answers.  Acme got our awning done in less time than expected and it turned out beautifully!  Very good quality Sunbrella material and the workmanship was top notch.  It was such a refreshing experience working with Acme Sunshades.  I highly recommend them to homeowners and business owners alike.</blockquote>

                                <blockquote class="whisper">I had Greg come out and measure for my daughters home in San Jose for fixed window awnings and a retractable awning. He measured up an showed me fabric samples and fixed awning frame samples photos and we designed three custom spear point awnings together. 
                                <br>
                                The design process is Super Simple when Greg guides you through the steps, he covers everything. And he mailed me a quotation the very next day, it was a few dollars more than the other bids I had gotten but I felt that is was worth it due to the fact that my awnings were to be custom one of a kind not just some average looking awning that the competitors were offering. The day of the installation came and due to our busy schedules we weren't available on a Saturday but Greg came through and met our schedule and installed on a Saturday at no extra charge. 
                                <br>
                                When the installation was complete it was exactly like he described them how they would look like every detail was taken into consideration. The retractable came with a lifetime warranty, no other vender had this type of warranty not even close. I will have Greg come out to my home in Portola Valley Next as we have some areas that require some attention due to late after noon sun issues.
                                <br>
                                I will most definitely use Greg again.</blockquote>

                                We couldn't be more happy with the way they turned out! The awnings help keep rain from our entryways and provide shade in the summer. The awnings are made from durable material  and look great!</blockquote>
