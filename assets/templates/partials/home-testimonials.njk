We worked with him to install a set of awnings under an arbor in our backyard.  He presented a number of proposals as we figured out various options and what we thought was worth spending.  When we needed a number of canvas samples, he arranged that without a hassle.  Install was a breeze and was done way before the rest of our project.  The awning itself is excellent. The fabric we chose lets in some light (they have many complete-block options) but provides excellent shade and has outside all the time even in the midday sun.</blockquote>

They did a great job, including painting the frames to match the canvas. Greg was great to work.  He provided the best quote and was kind enough to hold the price while we waited a couple of months for the painter's schedule to clear.  He was very responsive and responded to emails promptly, even at night and on weekends.  He even stopped by the house to check out the old awnings before pickup.  Greg kept me in the loop during the delivery window and even delivered on a Sunday, after other jobs on Saturday ran long and prevented Saturday delivery.   I would do business with Greg and Sunset in the future and highly recommend them.</blockquote>

Greg was quick to respond to my phone call about installation quote for SunSetter motorized awning that we bought online. His technician came over the same day to look at what we wanted to get done. They were prompt in scheduling installation. His technicians arrived on time and the installation was done in time. I had reached out to other businesses on yelp but the response time was very slow whereas Greg was so prompt to reply and set up an appointment, he also gave a competitive quote.</blockquote>

I contacted several awning companies to custom make an awning for our flooring store, Lawrence Flooring & Interiors.  After contacting 3 awning companies, Sunset Canvas & Awning outshined all the others in terms of response, knowledge, service, quality and competitive pricing.  I was completely in awe every step of the way with this professional company and their customer service.  The technician that came out to look at our site was Greg Parr.  He was fantastic and was very knowledgeable, efficient and helped me understand my options.  Every time I called with a question, Greg immediately got back to me with complete answers.  Acme got our awning done in less time than expected and it turned out beautifully!  Very good quality Sunbrella material and the workmanship was top notch.  It was such a refreshing experience working with Acme Sunshades.  I highly recommend them to homeowners and business owners alike.</blockquote>

                                <blockquote class="whisper">I had Greg come out and measure for my daughters home in San Jose for fixed window awnings and a retractable awning. He measured up an showed me fabric samples and fixed awning frame samples photos and we designed three custom spear point awnings together. 
                                <br>
                                The design process is Super Simple when Greg guides you through the steps, he covers everything. And he mailed me a quotation the very next day, it was a few dollars more than the other bids I had gotten but I felt that is was worth it due to the fact that my awnings were to be custom one of a kind not just some average looking awning that the competitors were offering. The day of the installation came and due to our busy schedules we weren't available on a Saturday but Greg came through and met our schedule and installed on a Saturday at no extra charge. 
                                <br>
                                When the installation was complete it was exactly like he described them how they would look like every detail was taken into consideration. The retractable came with a lifetime warranty, no other vender had this type of warranty not even close. I will have Greg come out to my home in Portola Valley Next as we have some areas that require some attention due to late after noon sun issues.

                                I will most definitely use Greg again.</blockquote>
